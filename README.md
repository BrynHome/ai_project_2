# ai_project_2
The purpose of this project is to use the Yelp Reviews academic dataset to create three different
machine learning models for use in four different machine learning tasks. A non-parametric decision
tree model, neural network, and probabilistic model are used. The first task is to predict the star
rating, between 1 and 5, of a specific review given the review text as input. The other three tasks are
predictions of the integer count of the number of times other users rated a specific review "funny",
"useful", or "cool". Feature extraction / engineering is used to extract meaningful information from
the text reviews to be used as input into machine learning models. The models are trained and
evaluated on a held out test set and their performance is measured using various classification and
regression metrics.
